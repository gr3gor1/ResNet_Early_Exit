# Early Exit Models

- **exit_blocks.py**: Implements the exiting branches used in early-exit ResNet variants.
- **resnet18_34_EE.py**: Implements early-exit variants of ResNet18 and ResNet34.
- **resnet50_EE.py**: Implements the early-exit ResNet50 variant.

## Usage

These scripts are used by `training_early_exit.py` to train early-exit (EE) ResNet models, and by `summarize.py` to evaluate the models.
