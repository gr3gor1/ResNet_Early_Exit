# Explainability Experiments

## Classification Reports & Confusion Matrices

This notebook explores the classification reports and confusion matrices for each exit across all model variants.

## Feature Analysis

We analyze statistical image features — brightness, contrast, homogeneity, and entropy — for the sets of test images exiting at different stages.

## Embeddings Features

We apply 2D and 3D t-SNE to the extracted embeddings to visualize and investigate differences among images across exits.
