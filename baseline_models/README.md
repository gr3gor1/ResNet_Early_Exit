# Baseline Models

- **residual_blocks.py**: Implements the residual blocks used in the models.
- **resnet18_34_backbone.py**: Implements the backbone of the ResNet18 and ResNet34 variants.
- **resnet50_backbone.py**: Implements the backbone of the ResNet50 variant.

## Usage

These scripts are used by `training_testing.py` to train standard ResNet models (without early-exit branches), and by `summarize.py` to evaluate the models.
